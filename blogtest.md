# My Favorite Vacation

I have had the pleasure of visiting a lot of places on vacation.
I have been to many countries and all over the United States, but my favorite place to go is **Disneyland**.

### Yep, that is right, _Disneyland_.

## Here are my top 5 reasons why Disneyland is the best place to vacay it up:
1. All your favorite characters are waiting to see you!
2. Did I mention the Matterhorn Macaroon?!?
